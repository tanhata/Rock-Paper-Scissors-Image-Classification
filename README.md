## Rock Paper Scissors Image Classification

Experimenting with image classification using variations of Convolutional Neural Networks using Tensorflor/Keras. The dataset used is the Rock Paper Scissors in Tensorflow datasets catalog. This code uses ```tensorflow```, ```keras```, ```numpy``` to train and validate classification accuracy. It also tackles overfitting, exploring variables in conv layers and hyperparameter tuning.
